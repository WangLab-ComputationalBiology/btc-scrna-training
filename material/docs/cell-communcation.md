# Cell-cell communication

## Motivation

Cell-cell communication analysis in single-cell studies delves into the intricate interactions between different cell types within a tissue or tumor. Utilizing scRNA-seq data, this analysis identifies potential signaling pathways and molecular messengers, like ligands and receptors, that mediate these interactions. By mapping out these communication networks, researchers gain insights into the cooperative and competitive dynamics that govern cellular behaviors. This understanding is crucial for deciphering the complex orchestration of cellular functions in health and disease, offering avenues to disrupt pathological interactions or enhance beneficial ones.

# Malignant meta-programs

## Motivation

Meta-programs in single-cell analysis streamline the intricate transcriptional patterns identified in diverse cell types through scRNA-seq. By condensing this complex data into overarching themes, meta-program analysis provides a clearer perspective on shared cellular processes. This approach is essential for harnessing the depth of scRNA-seq data, facilitating a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.

# Batch correction and evaluation

## Motivation

Batch correction in single-cell transcriptomics addresses unwanted technical variations in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. These variations, or batch effects, can arise from different experimental conditions or sequencing platforms. If uncorrected, it can hide true biological signals. Several algorithms, like Seurat's integration method, Harmony, and BBKNN, have been developed to mitigate these effects.

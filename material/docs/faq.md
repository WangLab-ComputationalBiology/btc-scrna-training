## How can I add my gene markers in the scRNA pipeline?

???+ note

    Yes. A user can easily add markers into [cell annotation](https://github.com/break-through-cancer/btc-scrna-pipeline/blob/main/assets/cell_markers_database.csv) database. Additionally, the user can contribute to cell annotation database by adding markers into the [collections](https://breakthroughcancer.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/TeamLab-BreakThroughCancerInformation/Shared%20Documents/scRNA-seq/3.0%20Pipelines/scRNAseq%20pipeline%20required%20tools.xlsx?d=wa91ee12a14cb4fc49c0b8d2936c75300&csf=1&web=1&e=5cuDZa&nav=MTVfezZBMzNGQkYzLTYxQjQtNEQ5RS05Rjg1LUYwMUUzQkYxNTE1OX0) sheet.

## Can I use my own reference genome on the pipeline?

???+ note

    Although not recommented for standards reasons. It is possible to add a custom genome at the Alignament step. Please, check the [Advanced](advanced.md) configurations for more explanation.

# Cell annotation

## Motivation

Cell annotation in single-cell studies assigns identities to cells based on their transcriptional profiles. Using scRNA-seq data, cells are categorized by specific marker genes, turning a complex gene expression matrix into a clear map of cellular diversity. This crucial step contextualizes the data, setting the stage for deeper analyses and insights into cell roles and interactions in various biological contexts.

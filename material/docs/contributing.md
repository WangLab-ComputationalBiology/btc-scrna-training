## Feedback and reporting bugs

We at scRNA sincerely appreciate your feedback. However, it is important to note that while we have achieved a stable version, several features still require further testing with different datasets. As a result, there may be occasional minor bugs or unexpected behaviors. If you encounter any bugs, we kindly request that you report them via GitHub issues [[1]](https://github.com/break-through-cancer/btc-scrna-pipeline).

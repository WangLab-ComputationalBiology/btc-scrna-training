# Cell trajectory

## Motivation

Pseudotrajectory analysis in single-cell transcriptomics reconstructs the developmental trajectories of cells, tracing their progression over time or through specific states. By ordering cells along these inferred paths, researchers can capture the dynamics of cellular differentiation, maturation, or response to stimuli. The primary drive behind this analysis is to uncover the temporal and transitional relationships between cells, offering a deeper understanding of developmental processes, disease progression, or treatment responses, and potentially highlighting key regulatory checkpoints or therapeutic targets.

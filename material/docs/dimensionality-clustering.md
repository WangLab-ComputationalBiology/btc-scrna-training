# Dimensionality reduction and clustering

## Motivation

Dimensionality reduction in single-cell studies compresses high-dimensional transcriptional data into a simpler form using methods like t-SNE, UMAP, or PCA. After dimensionality reduction simplifies high-dimensional data into a more manageable form, clustering becomes more effective and accurate.

Resolution determines the granularity of clustering. A higher resolution will result in more, smaller clusters, potentially capturing subtle differences between cell states. Conversely, a lower resolution might group distinct cell types or states into broader categories. Adjusting the resolution allows researchers to explore the data at various levels of detail, from broad cell types to finer subtypes or transitional states.

The optimal number of clusters is a crucial parameter to ensure meaningful categorization. Too few clusters might overlook important cellular heterogeneity, while too many can lead to over-segmentation, where genuinely similar cells are divided into unnecessary subgroups. Various methods, like the elbow method or silhouette analysis, can be employed to determine the optimal number, ensuring that the chosen clusters best represent the underlying data structure.
